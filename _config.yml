one_liner: Studying the building blocks of nature
description: >
  We are interested in studying exotic decays of the higgs boson, machine learning based new analysis techniques, and microelectronics for fundamental physics. 
  I am a Research Associate at the [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu) through the [Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship](https://aiscience.uchicago.edu/fellows).
  I received my Ph.D. in physics from Harvard University in 2023 and dual B.S. in physics and mathematics from MIT in 2019.
