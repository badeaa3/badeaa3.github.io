    	I am an experimental particle physicist interested in  understanding fundamental aspects of nature. Using high energy  particle collisions, I provides new insights into searches for Beyond the Standard Model physics and matter in extreme  conditions, similar to those of the early universe. I have done machine learning based searches in many jet final states of proton proton collisions and studies of high-density quantum  chromodynamics using electron-positron collisions. I aims to build the next-generation of experiments to understand properties of the Higgs boson and nature of dark matter by developing AI-engrained chips, sensors, and techniques.
