    	I am an experimental particle physicist interested in  understanding fundamental aspects of nature. Using high energy  particle collisions, I provides new insights into searches for Beyond the Standard Model physics and matter in extreme  conditions, similar to those of the early universe. I have done machine learning based searches in many jet final states of proton proton collisions and studies of high-density quantum  chromodynamics using electron-positron collisions. I aims to build the next-generation of experiments to understand properties of the Higgs boson and nature of dark matter by developing AI-engrained chips, sensors, and techniques.

        I am a particle physicist working on the <a href="https://atlas.cern">ATLAS experiment</a> at the <a href="https://home.web.cern.ch">Large Hadron Collider</a> in Geneva, Switzerland. I build hardware, lead analyses, and develop machine learning algorithms to answer questions about the universe.
